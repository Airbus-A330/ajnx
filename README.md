## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps carefully to set up and run the project locally or in production:

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

- Locate the `.env.example` file at the project root.
- Fill out all required fields:

  | Field | Description |
  |:--|:--|
  | `DB_HOST` | Your MySQL database host (e.g., `localhost`, or a remote IP) |
  | `DB_USER` | Your MySQL username |
  | `DB_PASSWORD` | Your MySQL password |
  | `DB_NAME` | Your database name (e.g., `AJNXBanking`) |
  | `PORT` | Port to run the backend server (e.g., `3306`) |
  | `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key used for signing JWT tokens |

- **Rename** the file from `.env.example` to `.env` (remove `.example`!)

### 2. Install Required Packages

From the root of your project, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all server-side and client-side dependencies.

### 3. Build the Frontend

Before starting in production mode, you MUST build the React frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the React code into the `dist` folder.

### 4. Start the Server

Choose your preferred mode:

#### a) Production Mode

- Use this for fast startup.
- **Important:** You must complete the `npm run build` step first!

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

Notes:
- Minimal logs are printed.
- Fast and optimized, but harder to debug.

#### b) Development Mode

- Good for testing and active development.
- Automatically rebuilds when files are changed.

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Notes:
- Slower startup since the project is recompiled.
- Much easier for debugging errors.

### Recommendations

- Always test your changes in **development mode** first.
- Switch to **production mode** only when you're ready to deploy or demo.

---

## Notes

- Minimal logs are available in production.
- Development mode shows detailed errors and auto-reloads.
- Database setup (schema, tables, procedures) must be completed separately.
